Dear Dr. Sharif,
 
Thank you for submitting an application for the National Center for Women & IT (NCWIT) Student Seed Fund on behalf of ACM-W Student Chapter Youngstown State University.
 
Your application has been given careful consideration by the application review committee. We regret to inform you that it was not selected as a winner during this cycle of the Student Seed Fund. It is always extremely difficult making the selections as the caliber of submitted proposals is strong. 
 
We hope you consider applying again during the next cycle of the Student Seed Fund. Please monitor our Student Seed Fund webpage for proposal submission information and FAQ's. In order to assist you in strengthening your application for future cycles, we have attached the PDF of your application with the reviewer's scores and comments starting around page 8. 
 
We hope your interest in the NCWIT Student Seed Fund will continue for future application cycles. Thank you for your interest in this program.
 
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the NCWIT Student Seed Fund program manager, Stephanie Weber at stephanie.weber@ncwit.org.
